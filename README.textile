h1. Template Engine Benchmarks

This repository contains a set of very basic benchmarks to see which template engine was the fastest.
While I know some benchmarks aren't very accurate (HAML has to parse much more) I tried to keep all templates as similar as possible.

* Liquid
* ERB
* Etanni (ships with Ramaze)
* Tenjin (with and without cache)
* HAML (with and without :ugly)
* Lokar
